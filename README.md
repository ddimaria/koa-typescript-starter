## Prerequisites

* Node.js (8+): recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* Docker (if building a docker image) https://www.docker.com/docker-mac

## Installation

First, clone this repo and `cd` into the main directory. Then:

```shell
npm install
```

## Development

During development, the `/app` folder is being watched for changes.

All changes invoke the TypeScript compiler, which restarts the app upon completion.

```shell
npm run watch
```

## Build the Server

To compile the TypeScript code and place into the `/dist` folder:

```shell
npm build
```

## Code Linter

A TypeScript linter has been added to keep code consistent among developers.

```shell
npm run lint
```

To autofix linting errors (not all errors are auto-fixable):

```shell
npm run fix
```

## Tests and Coverage

The test coverage percentage should be 90% or greater for any submitted PRs.

For TDD, invoke testing by:

```shell
npm test
```

For an html and text coverage report (html located in the `/coverage` folder):

```shell
npm run coverage
```

## Docker

To build a container using the `dockerfile`:

```shell
npm run image:build -- --no-cache
```
